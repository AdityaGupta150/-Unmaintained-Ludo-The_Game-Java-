[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/af9190f3627842869828fb1c8307b818)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/AdityaGupta150/UNMAINTAINED-Ludo-The_Game-Java?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=AdityaGupta150/UNMAINTAINED-Ludo-The_Game-Java&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

This is the java version of my original Ludo-The_Game implemented in C++. See that, for any new features (will will always be the case, even now, but this one works too)

A trial implementation of my Ludo-The_Game, in Java, for exam practise.

But, you can always create a PULL REQUEST, OR ANY BUG. There is a lot of chance for finding in this repo ;D

As for the code quality, its mainly the 'code style' part, which requires experience no? :|
